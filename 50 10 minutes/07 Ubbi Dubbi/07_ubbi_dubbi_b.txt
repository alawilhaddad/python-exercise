Einstein's parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was originally a featherbed
salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His mother, the former Pauline Koch,
ran the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who went by the name Maja), born two years after Albert.
